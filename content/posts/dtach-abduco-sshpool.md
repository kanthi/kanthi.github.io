## Introduction

When working on remote servers or even on your local machine, there are times when you need to run a long-running process or maintain a terminal session even after you disconnect. Tools like `screen` and `tmux` are very popular for this purpose, but they can sometimes feel a bit heavy with features you might not need.

In this post, I'll explore three lightweight alternatives: `dtach`, `abduco`, and `sshpool`. These tools are designed to do one thing and do it well: detach and reattach to terminal sessions, or in the case of sshpool, manage connections.

## `dtach`

`dtach` is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of `screen`. It's designed to be transparent and unobtrusive. It allows a program to be run in an environment that is protected from the controlling terminal.

### How it works

`dtach` creates a socket that your terminal can attach to. The program you run inside `dtach` is unaware that it's not directly connected to a terminal. When you detach, the program keeps running, and you can reattach to the same socket later.

### Basic Usage

1.  **Start a new session:**
    ```/dev/null/example.bash
    dtach -c /tmp/mysession my_long_running_command
    ```
    This creates a new `dtach` session with a socket at `/tmp/mysession` and runs `my_long_running_command`. You can now safely close your terminal.

2.  **Detach:**
    To detach from the session without closing it, you press `Ctrl+\\`.

3.  **List sessions:**
    `dtach` doesn't have a built-in way to list sessions, so you'll have to keep track of your socket files (e.g., by listing files in `/tmp`).

4.  **Reattach to a session:**
    ```/dev/null/example.bash
    dtach -a /tmp/mysession
    ```

## `abduco`

`abduco` is a tool for session management which is inspired by `dtach` but offers a cleaner user interface. It provides session management, i.e. it allows programs to be run independently of their controlling terminal. `abduco` is often used with `dvtm` (dynamic virtual terminal manager) to get a `tmux`/`screen`-like experience.

### How it works

`abduco` manages sessions and handles the socket creation and attachment for you. It provides a simple command-line interface to create, list, and attach to sessions.

### Basic Usage

1.  **Start a new session:**
    ```/dev/null/example.bash
    abduco -c my-session-name zsh
    ```
    This creates a new session named `my-session-name` and starts a `zsh` shell inside it.

2.  **Detach:**
    To detach from the session, you press `Ctrl+\\`.

3.  **List sessions:**
    ```/dev/null/example.bash
    abduco
    ```
    This will show a list of active sessions.

4.  **Reattach to a session:**
    ```/dev/null/example.bash
    abduco -a my-session-name
    ```

## `sshpool`

`sshpool` is a connection pool for SSH. It's not a general-purpose session manager like `dtach` or `abduco`, but it's very useful for maintaining a persistent SSH connection that you can share across multiple local terminals. This can speed up subsequent SSH connections by reusing the master connection, which can be particularly useful when you need to connect to the same host multiple times.

### How it works

`sshpool` creates a master SSH connection to a host. When you want to connect to that host again, `sshpool` creates a new session over the existing master connection, which avoids the overhead of a full SSH handshake.

### Basic Usage

`sshpool` is designed to be a wrapper around the `ssh` command.

1.  **Start a new pooled connection:**
    ```/dev/null/example.bash
    sshpool user@hostname
    ```
    The first time you run this, it establishes a master connection.

2.  **Connect using the pool:**
    Open a new terminal and run the same command again:
    ```/dev/null/example.bash
    sshpool user@hostname
    ```
    This second connection will be much faster as it uses the existing master connection.

### Key differences from `dtach`/`abduco`

-   `sshpool` is specifically for managing remote connections via SSH.
-   It doesn't keep a session running on the *remote* server if you disconnect. It keeps the *connection* alive from your *local* machine.
-   You can't "reattach" to a running process on the server in the same way. Each `sshpool` command gives you a new shell on the remote host.

## Conclusion

-   **`dtach`**: The minimalist's choice. It's perfect if you just need to detach and reattach to a single process and you're happy to manage the socket files yourself.
-   **`abduco`**: A great balance. It's lightweight but provides a more user-friendly interface for managing multiple sessions. It's a fantastic replacement for `dtach` if you want a little more convenience.
-   **`sshpool`**: Solves a different but related problem. It's for speeding up repeated SSH connections, not for keeping remote processes alive after you disconnect.

For the task of keeping a process running on a remote server after you log off, `abduco` or `dtach` are the right tools for the job. If you find yourself SSHing to the same server multiple times from your local machine and want to speed things up, give `sshpool` a try.
